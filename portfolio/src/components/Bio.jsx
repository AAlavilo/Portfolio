      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Antti, a passionate software developer with a focus on 
        building scalable and user-friendly applications. With a strong foundation 
        in full-stack development, I enjoy creating efficient back-end solutions as 
        much as designing intuitive front-end interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey into software development began with introduction to JavaScript 
        and now I am almost a full fledged engineer. Since then, 
        I've been continuously learning and improving my skills in modern technologies like 
        React, Node.js, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always eager to take on new challenges, contribute to innovative projects, 
        and collaborate with others in the tech community.
      </p>
